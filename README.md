# Commands
Run `h!help` in your server to get a list of the commands Hulkbot has!
A few useful ones are ban, kick, and mute.

# Premium
I don't know what I'm going to do about Hulkbot Premium right now. I don't have a bank account for the money to go into, therefore the concept of Hulkbot Premium is obsolete. The music module will be free until I can setup the premium system.

# Backstory
Not many bots have a backstory. Hulkbot does though! A quite lengthy one to be exact.  
Hulkbot began as a measley music bot for my server, running SexualRhinoceros's MusicBot. I eventually was inspired to make my own bot that was more than just a fork of somebody else's code. Development of Alpha Hulkbot began in March of 2017! I developed the first stable version of Hulkbot in Node.js version 7, using Discord.js v9. Let's fast-forward to 2018. Hulkbot died due to some really bad real life issues on my end, and I really didn't know how to fix it. I waited a year, and something inspired me to rewrite a better, more stable version of Hulkbot. Hulkbot's second first birthday will be November 13th, 2020.
